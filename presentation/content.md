# What does a Full-Stack Web Developer do?

sub

- Working on backend _and_ frontend

sub

- The **backend** is not only a single web server application but:
  - Server Application (Node.js, Spring, ...)
  - API (REST, Postman, ...)
  - Database (SQL, NoSQL, Graph Databases, ORM, ...)
    - including backup strategies, migrations, ...
  - Webserver administration (Apache, nginx, Caddy, ...)
  - Hosting (Self-hosted, v-server, cloud, ...)
  - ...

sub

- The **frontend** is not only HTML
  - Styling ((S)CSS, LESS, ...)
    - with libraries (Bootstrap, Tailwind, Foundation, ...)
  - Frameworks (React, Vue.js, Angualar, ...)
  - Libraries (jquery, lodash, axios, d3, ...)
  - Asynchronous communication (axios, fetch, ...)
  - ...

sub

- Often using various _languages_
  - Javascript
    - or Typescript
  - Java
    - or Kotlin
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - PHP
  - SQL / DB query languages

sub

- Modern web development often involves
  - dependency management (npm, yarn, ...)
    - i.e., combining other people's work into one nice thing
  - transpilations (Typescript -> Javascript)
    - i.e., transforming one language into another
  - compilation (Javascript -> Web Assembly)
    - i.e., transforming on language into a low-level language / machine code
  - just-in-time compilation (Web Assembly)
    - i.e., a VM optimizing code at run time
  - bundling / build tools / task runners (webpack, browserify, vite, gulp, ... )
    - i.e., managing the above tasks
    - bundling = combining multiple files into a single **small** one / a few **small** ones

sub

# And the good thing:
### You learn most of this stuff along the way :)

But you need to have a basic understanding to able to understand what you are still lacking and what to be looking for.

# This is the goal of this course:
### To give you enough knowledge to get started developing full-stack
### knowing that there are topics you could dive into deeper
